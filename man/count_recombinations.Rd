\title{Count recombination events per chromosome (internal function)}
\usage{
count_recombinations(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Processed data frame from process_genotype_data()}
}
\value{
Data frame with recombination counts containing:
\itemize{
  \item{chromosome}{Chromosome identifier}
  \item{num_recomb}{Number of recombination events detected}
}
}
\description{
Identifies and counts recombination events by detecting changes in
founder strain assignments between adjacent genomic positions. This
function is essential for quantifying genetic diversity and mapping
recombination hotspots.
}
\details{
Recombination events are detected by comparing the diplotype at each
marker position with the previous position. A change in diplotype
indicates a recombination event has occurred.
}
\section{Internal Function}{

This function is internal and not exported. Advanced users can access it
with \code{gbrsR:::count_recombinations}.

\examples{
