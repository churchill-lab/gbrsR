\title{gbrsR: GBRS for R}
\description{
A comprehensive R package for visualizing genome reconstructions from GBRS
(Genome-Based Reconstruction of Strains) data. Supports NPZ files containing
genotypic probability matrices and generates publication-ready genome plots
with configurable parameters.

A comprehensive R package for analyzing and visualizing genetic recombination
data from Diversity Outbred (DO) and Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse studies.
Provides tools for loading NPZ genotype probability files, processing
recombination data, and creating publication-ready genome plots.

\details{
GBRS Mosaic Plotter


This package provides functions to:
\itemize{
  \item Load and process NPZ files containing genotypic probability data
  \item Analyze founder strain contributions across the genome
  \item Count recombination events per chromosome
  \item Generate publication-quality genome plots with customizable styling
  \item Save plots in various formats (PDF, PNG, SVG)
}



The package includes functions for:
\itemize{
  \item Loading and processing NPZ genotype probability files
  \item Analyzing recombination patterns across chromosomes
  \item Creating customizable genome plots with founder strain information
  \item Generating compact and publication-ready visualizations
}
}
\section{CRITICAL DEPENDENCY WARNING}{

This package REQUIRES Python and the reticulate R package to function!
Without these dependencies, you will get errors like:
- "Error: Please install reticulate"
- "FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory"

See the README for complete installation instructions.
